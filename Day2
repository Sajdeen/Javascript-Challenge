//Act:1 => Arithmetic operators

// Task1: Wap to add two numbers and log a program to console
let a = 5;
let b = 4;
console.log(a + b); // Outputs: 9

// Task2: Wap to subtract two numbers and log a program to console
let a1 = 15;
let b1 = 4; // Changed variable name to avoid re-declaration error
console.log(a1 - b1); // Outputs: 11

// Task3: Wap to multiply two numbers and log a program to console
let c = 15;
let d = 4; // Changed variable name to avoid re-declaration error
console.log(c \* d); // Outputs: 60

// Task4: Wap to divide two numbers and log a program to console
let y = 15;
let z = 3;
console.log(y / z); // Outputs: 5

// Task5: Wap to find a remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console
let x = 15;
let y1 = 4; // Changed variable name to avoid re-declaration error
console.log(x % y1); // Outputs: 3

// Assignment Operators

// Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console
let a2 = 5;
let b2 = 6; // Changed variable name to avoid re-declaration error
console.log(a2 += b2); // Outputs: 11

// Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console
let b3 = 5;
let a3 = 6; // Changed variable name to avoid re-declaration error
console.log(b3 -= a3); // Outputs: -1
